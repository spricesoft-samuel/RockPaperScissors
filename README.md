# RockPaperScissors
A little project for a technical demo
I was asked to write a Rock Paper Scissors game but to do so using SOLID principles and with a focus on unit/automation tests.

The commit history is the story of how I went about desiging and writing this code.
It details my thought process and the way I tackled the problem.
